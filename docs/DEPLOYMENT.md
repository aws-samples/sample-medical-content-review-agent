# Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying Medical Content Review to AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 20+** installed (see [AWS guide for installing Node.js on EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html))
- **AWS CLI** configured with credentials (`aws configure`) - see [AWS CLI Configuration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
- **AWS CDK CLI** installed: `npm install -g aws-cdk` (see [CDK Getting Started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting-started.html))
- **Python 3.10+** - required for deployment scripts
- **uv** - Python package manager used for running scripts: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (see [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- **Docker** - Required for all deployments. See [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Verify with `docker ps`. Alternatively, [Finch](https://github.com/runfinch/finch) can be used on Mac. See below if you have a non-ARM machine.
- An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create:
  - S3 buckets
  - Cognito User Pools
  - Amplify Hosting apps
  - Bedrock AgentCore resources (Runtime, Gateway, Memory)
  - Lambda functions, ECR repositories
  - DynamoDB tables, API Gateway
  - IAM roles and policies

## Configuration

### 1. Create Your Configuration File

The deployment configuration lives in `infra-cdk/config.yaml`. This file is gitignored (it may contain API keys and personal settings). Start by copying the example:

```bash
cp infra-cdk/.config_example.yaml infra-cdk/config.yaml
```

Then edit `infra-cdk/config.yaml` to customize your deployment:

```yaml
stack_name_base: your-project-name  # Change this to your preferred stack name (max 35 chars)
region: null  # AWS region to deploy the stack (e.g., us-west-2). If null, uses your AWS CLI default region.

# Optional: Set to automatically create an admin user and email credentials
# If not provided, you'll need to manually create users via AWS Console
admin_user_email: null

auto_deploy_frontend: true # Automatically deploy frontend after CDK deploy (when using npm run deploy)

backend:
  pattern: medical-content-review
  deployment_type: docker # Available deployment types: docker (default), zip
  model_id: bedrock-model-id # Model ID for the agent (with cross-region prefix)

# Tools configuration
# enabled: whether the tool is deployed and available (true/false)
# default_on: whether the tool is toggled on by default in the UI (true/false)
# required: fields that must be non-null for the tool to work
tools:
  pubmed:  # Search peer-reviewed biomedical literature
    enabled: true
    default_on: true
  openfda:  # Search FDA drug label database
    enabled: true
    default_on: true
  clinicaltrials:  # Search clinical studies
    enabled: true
    default_on: true
  bedrock_kb:  # Query Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases (for approved claims DB)
    enabled: false
    default_on: false
    required:
      knowledge_base_id: null  # Replace with your Bedrock Knowledge Base ID
   ...
```

**Important**:
- Change `stack_name_base` to a unique name for your project to avoid conflicts
- Maximum length is 35 characters (due to AWS AgentCore runtime naming constraints)
- Set `region` to deploy to a specific AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`). If left as `null`, the deployment uses your AWS CLI default region
- If `config.yaml` is not found, the deployment will fall back to `.config_example.yaml` defaults


### 2. API Keys and Data Sources

The reference-verification tools used by the medical review agent rely on either public APIs (no key required) or your own AWS account. The table below summarizes what is needed for each tool:

| Tool | External API? | API Key Required? | Registration Needed? | Provider |
|------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Bedrock Knowledge Base | ❌ No (AWS) | ❌ No (needs KB ID) | No | AWS |
| ClinicalTrials.gov Search | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | No | [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) |
| Nova Web Grounding | ❌ No (AWS) | ❌ No | No | AWS |
| OpenFDA Drug Search | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | No | [open.fda.gov](https://open.fda.gov/) |
| PubMed Search | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | No | [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) |
| S3 File Reader | ❌ No (AWS) | ❌ No | No | AWS |

To use the Bedrock Knowledge Base tool, set `tools.bedrock_kb.enabled: true` in `infra-cdk/config.yaml` and provide your `knowledge_base_id` under `required:`. If the ID is left as `null` but the tool is enabled, the tool will deploy but fail at runtime when invoked.

### Deployment Types

Medical Content Review supports two deployment types for AgentCore Runtime. Set `deployment_type` in `infra-cdk/config.yaml`:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `docker` (default) | Builds container image, pushes to ECR |
| `zip` | Packages code via Lambda, uploads to S3 |

**Note**: Docker is required for both deployment types. The `zip` option only affects how the agent runtime is packaged. Other Lambda functions in the stack still use Docker for dependency bundling.

**Use Docker (default) when:**
- You need native C/C++ libraries without ARM64 wheels on PyPI
- Your deployment package exceeds 250 MB
- You need custom OS-level dependencies
- You want maximum compatibility

**Use ZIP when:**
- You want faster iteration during development
- Your dependencies are pure Python or have ARM64 wheels available
- You need higher session throughput

**ZIP packaging includes**: The `patterns/` and `gateway/` directories are bundled together with dependencies from `requirements.txt`. This matches the `COPY` commands in the Docker deployment's Dockerfile.

## Deployment Steps

### TL;DR version
Here are the commands to deploy backend and frontend:
```bash
cd infra-cdk
cp .config_example.yaml config.yaml  # Create your config (edit as needed)
npm install
cdk bootstrap # Once ever
npm run deploy
```

This runs `cdk deploy` and then automatically deploys the frontend if `auto_deploy_frontend: true` is set in `config.yaml` (enabled by default). To deploy them separately:

```bash
cdk deploy                    # Backend only
npm run deploy:frontend       # Frontend only
```

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install infrastructure dependencies:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
npm install
```

**Note**: Frontend dependencies are automatically installed during deployment via Docker bundling, so no separate frontend `npm install` is required.

### 2. Bootstrap CDK (First Time Only)

If this is your first time using CDK in this AWS account/region:

```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

### 3. Deploy backend and frontend

Build and deploy the complete stack:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:

1. Run `cdk deploy` to provision the backend (Cognito, AgentCore runtime, Gateway tools, etc.)
2. If `auto_deploy_frontend: true` in `config.yaml`, automatically deploy the frontend to Amplify Hosting

The frontend deployment generates `aws-exports.json` from CDK stack outputs (including tool configuration), builds the React app, and uploads it to Amplify.

**Note**: The deployment takes approximately 5-10 minutes due to container building and AgentCore setup.

You will see the URL for the application in the script's output, which will look similar to this:

```
ℹ App URL: https://main.d123abc456def7.amplifyapp.com
```

To deploy backend or frontend independently:

```bash
cdk deploy                    # Backend only
npm run deploy:frontend       # Frontend only
```

### 4. Create a Cognito User (if necessary)

**If you provided `admin_user_email` in config:**

- Check your email for temporary password
- Sign in and change password on first login

**If you didn't provide email:**

1. Go to the [AWS Cognito Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
2. Find your User Pool (named `{stack_name_base}-user-pool`)
3. Click on the User Pool
4. Go to "Users" tab
5. Click "Create user"
6. Fill in the user details:
   - **Email**: Your email address
   - **Temporary password**: Create a temporary password
   - **Mark email as verified**: Check this box
7. Click "Create user"

### 5. Access the Application

1. Open the Amplify Hosting URL in your browser
2. Sign in with the Cognito user you created
3. You'll be prompted to change your temporary password on first login

## Post-Deployment

### Updating the Application

To update both backend and frontend:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
npm run deploy
```

To update only the frontend (e.g., after changing tool flags in `config.yaml`):

```bash
cd infra-cdk
npm run deploy:frontend
```

To update only the backend:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
cdk deploy
```

### Monitoring and Logs

- **Frontend logs**: Check Amplify Hosting build and access logs in the Amplify console
- **Backend logs**: Check CloudWatch logs for the AgentCore runtime and tool Lambda functions
- **Build logs**: Container images are built locally via CDK Docker asset bundling; build output appears in the `cdk deploy` terminal session

## Cleanup

To remove all resources:

```bash
cd infra-cdk
cdk destroy --force
```

**Warning**: This will delete all data including S3 buckets created during deployment and ECR images.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **`cdk deploy` fails with Docker errors**

   - Ensure Docker is installed and the daemon is running: `docker ps`
   - On Mac, open Docker Desktop or start Finch: `finch vm start`
   - On Linux: `sudo systemctl start docker`

2. **"Architecture incompatible" or "exec format error" during Docker build**

   - This occurs when deploying from a non-ARM machine without cross-platform build setup
   - Follow the "Docker Cross-Platform Build Setup" instructions in the Prerequisites section
   - Ensure you've installed QEMU emulation: `docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all`
   - Verify ARM64 support: `docker buildx ls` should show `linux/arm64` in platforms

3. **"Agent Runtime ARN not configured"**

   - Ensure the backend stack deployed successfully
   - Check that SSM parameters were created correctly

4. **Authentication errors**

   - Verify you created a Cognito user
   - Check that the user's email is verified

5. **Build failures**

   - Review the `cdk deploy` output for Docker bundling errors
   - Ensure your agent code in `patterns/` is valid

6. **Permission errors**
   - Verify your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions
   - Check IAM roles created by the stack

### Getting Help

- Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
- Review the CDK deployment output for any warnings
- Ensure all prerequisites are met

## Security Considerations

- The Cognito User Pool is configured with strong password policies
- All frontend communication uses HTTPS via Amplify Hosting
- AgentCore runtime uses JWT authentication
- IAM roles follow least-privilege principles

For production deployments, consider:

- Enabling MFA on Cognito users
- Setting up custom domains with your own certificates
- Configuring additional monitoring and alerting
- Implementing backup strategies for any persistent data


## Docker Cross-Platform Build Setup (Required for non-ARM machines)

**Important**: BedrockAgentCore Runtime only supports ARM64 architecture. If you're deploying from a non-ARM machine (x86_64/amd64), you need to enable Docker's cross-platform building capabilities.

Check your machine architecture:
```bash
uname -m
```

If the output is `x86_64` (not `aarch64` or `arm64`), run these commands:

1. **Install QEMU for ARM64 emulation:**
   ```bash
   docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
   ```

2. **Enable Docker buildx and create a multi-platform builder:**
   ```bash
   docker buildx create --use --name multiarch --driver docker-container
   docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
   ```

3. **Verify ARM64 support is available:**
   ```bash
   docker buildx ls
   ```
   You should see `linux/arm64` in the platforms list.

**Note**: This setup is only required once per machine. The CDK deployment will automatically use these capabilities to build ARM64 containers.


## Understanding aws-exports.json

The `aws-exports.json` file is a critical configuration file that enables the React frontend to communicate with AWS Cognito for authentication. This file is automatically generated during frontend deployment and contains the necessary configuration parameters for Cognito authentication.

**What is aws-exports.json?**

The `aws-exports.json` file contains authentication and tool configuration that the React application reads at runtime. It's created automatically by the frontend deployment script and placed in `frontend/public/aws-exports.json`.

**Why is it necessary?**

This configuration file is essential because:

- It provides the React application with the correct Cognito User Pool and Client IDs
- It specifies the authentication endpoints and redirect URIs
- It configures the authentication flow parameters
- It includes tool configuration (which tools are enabled and toggled on by default in the UI)
- Without this file, Cognito authentication will not work and tool toggles will fall back to defaults

**How is it created?**

The file is automatically generated by `deploy-frontend.py` which:

1. Extracts configuration from your deployed CDK stack outputs
2. Automatically detects the AWS region from the CloudFormation stack ARN
3. Retrieves the required values: `CognitoClientId`, `CognitoUserPoolId`, and `AmplifyUrl`
4. Generates the configuration file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "authority": "https://cognito-idp.region.amazonaws.com/user-pool-id",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "redirect_uri": "https://your-amplify-url",
  "post_logout_redirect_uri": "https://your-amplify-url",
  "response_type": "code",
  "scope": "email openid profile",
  "automaticSilentRenew": true,
  "agentRuntimeArn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:region:account:runtime/runtime-id",
  "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
  "feedbackApiUrl": "https://your-api-gateway-url",
  "agentPattern": "medical-content-review",
  "tools": {
    "pubmed": { "enabled": true, "default_on": true },
    "openfda": { "enabled": true, "default_on": true },
    "clinicaltrials": { "enabled": true, "default_on": true },
    "s3": { "enabled": true, "default_on": true },
    "nova": { "enabled": true, "default_on": false }
  }
}
```

**Important**: You should not manually edit this file as it's regenerated on each deployment. If authentication isn't working or tool toggles aren't reflecting your `config.yaml` changes, redeploy the frontend with `npm run deploy:frontend` (or use `npm run deploy` to deploy everything).

> **Note**: `config.yaml` is gitignored because it may contain API keys and personal settings. The tracked `.config_example.yaml` provides safe defaults. If `config.yaml` is missing during deployment, the system will automatically fall back to `.config_example.yaml` and print a warning.
